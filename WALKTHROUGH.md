# Agent Orchestration System Walkthrough

## Getting Started

1. Start the Backend Server:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
The backend server will run at http://localhost:3001

2. Start the Frontend Application:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
The frontend will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000

## Understanding Agents

### What are Agents?
Agents in this system are specialized AI components that can:
- Process specific types of input
- Perform specialized tasks
- Learn from interactions
- Provide structured responses

### Adding Agents
When you click the "Add Agent" button, a new agent is created with:
- A unique ID
- A name (e.g., "Agent 1", "Agent 2")
- A description of its capabilities
- A set of predefined capabilities

### Agent Capabilities
Each agent comes with two default capabilities:
- `capability1`: Basic text processing and analysis
- `capability2`: Contextual understanding and response generation

## Using the System

### 1. Adding Agents
1. Click the "Add Agent" button in the Agents section
2. A new agent will appear in the dropdown menu
3. Each agent is automatically assigned a unique ID and capabilities

### 2. Selecting an Agent
1. Choose an agent from the dropdown menu in the Execute section
2. The selected agent will be used for processing your input

### 3. Providing Input
You can ask the agent to:
- Analyze text
- Generate responses
- Process data
- Answer questions
- Perform specific tasks

Example inputs:
```
"Analyze this text and provide a summary"
"What are the main points in this document?"
"Generate a response to this customer query"
"Process this data and identify patterns"
```

### 4. Executing Tasks
1. Enter your input in the textarea
2. Click the "Execute" button
3. The agent will process your input and provide a response

### 5. Viewing Results
The Results section shows:
- Execution status (Success/Failed)
- Output from the agent
- Performance metrics:
  - Duration (ms)
  - CPU usage (%)
  - Memory usage (%)
  - Network usage (%)

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Text Analysis
```
Input: "Please analyze this article and provide key points"
Agent Response: 
- Main topic identification
- Key points extraction
- Summary generation
```

### 2. Data Processing
```
Input: "Process this dataset and identify trends"
Agent Response:
- Data analysis
- Trend identification
- Visual representation
```

### 3. Question Answering
```
Input: "What is the best approach to solve this problem?"
Agent Response:
- Problem analysis
- Solution suggestions
- Implementation steps
```

## Best Practices

1. Be specific in your inputs
2. Provide context when necessary
3. Use clear and concise language
4. Check the execution metrics for performance
5. Review error messages if execution fails

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the backend server is running
2. Verify the agent is selected
3. Ensure input is properly formatted
4. Review error messages in the Results section
5. Try restarting both frontend and backend servers

## Advanced Features

The system supports:
- Multiple agent types
- Parallel execution
- Performance monitoring
- Error handling
- Context management

## Security Considerations

- All communications are local
- No data is stored permanently
- Each execution is independent
- No sensitive data should be processed

## Future Enhancements

Planned features:
- Custom agent creation
- Advanced capability configuration
- Persistent storage
- User authentication
- API integration
